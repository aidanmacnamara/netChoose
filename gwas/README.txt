There is a file called "Selected_77traits_info.xlsx".
This file includes 77 traits with Mesh_IDs and their 3333 high confidence genes. 
Traits and genes was selected from coloc and piccolo all by all results.
Piccolo results came from "Supplementary Data Set 2 - All PICCOLO results.txt" of piccolo paper.
Coloc results came from file "aba_colocs_default_positive_20190102.csv.gz".I checked with Karsten and got permission to save it in this folder. 
TIPS information came from "Pprojects_1Nov2018_TIPSinterpretation.csv"
The MESH_ID was matched with both Piccolo and coloc results by using the latest file "analysis_with_mesh_v2" sent by Karsten Sieber.
we selected Traits with 5+ high confidence genes with information in TIPS.
Please see the key_info worksheet for more information.

There is a file called "info77_21_tips.xlsx".
This file includes 77 Mesh_IDs (21 after filtering) in both TIPS and "Selected_77traits_info.xlsx".
It contains information about Total number of genes in TIPS, Total number of genes clinically failed in TIPS,
Total number of genes succeeded in TIPS, and the same information for a subset of high confidence genes.  
Please see the Key worksheet for more information. 
 
There is a file called "trait77_analysis_info.xlsx" which include 77 traits, and information about the analysed data (column "analysis2" or "pmid")
